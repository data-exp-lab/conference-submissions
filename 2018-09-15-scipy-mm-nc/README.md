### Directions

**The Short Description**

The brief description which will appear in the online program and give
attendees a basic sense of your talk. This should be around 100 words or less.

**The Long Description**

Your placement in the program will be based on reviews of your detailed
description. This should be a roughly 500 word detailed outline of your
presentation. This outline should concisely describe software of interest to
the SciPy community, tools or techniques for more effective computing, or how
scientific Python was applied to solve a research problem. A traditional
background/motivation, methods, results, and conclusion structure is encouraged
but not required. Links to project websites, source code repositories, figures,
full papers, and evidence of public speaking ability are encouraged.

**Tips**

* Submit your proposal early.
* In your abstract, be sure to include answers to some basic questions:
  * Who is the intended audience for your talk?
  * What, specifically, will attendees learn from your talk?
* Ensure that your talk will be relevant to a broad range of people. If your talk
is on a particular Python package or piece of software, it should useful to
more than a niche group.
* Include links to source code, articles, blog posts, or other writing that adds
context to the presentation.
* If you've given a talk, tutorial, or other presentation before, include that
information as well as a link to slides or a video if they're available.
* SciPy talks are generally 25 minutes with 2-3 minutes for questions. Please
keep the length of time in mind as you structure your outline.
& Your talk should not be a commercial for your companyâ€™s product. However, you
are welcome to talk about how your company solved a problem, or notable
open-source projects that may benefit attendees.
