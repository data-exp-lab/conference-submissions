The Long Description:

The authors of this toolkit are Nathanael Clausen and Madicken Munk. Both
authors intend to present their respective contributions to the project. 
Madicken developed the backend pixelization routines that port
data arrays from yt using rust to webassembly. 
Nathanael will discuss developing a jupyter widget that readily interfaces with
yt and webassembly to interactively visualize data using widgets in 
Jupyter notebooks. Our
presentation will compare data visualization methods with yt and demonstrate that
this tool allows for a high degree of control and ease of use that differs from
direct API interaction or immersive visualization. Our presentation will
include a live demonstration of our tool on a sample yt dataset. This
demonstration will show the features available to explore and manipulate data 
using the widget. We will also discuss the
lessons learned from developing this tool, such that any person working with
other tools that visualize volumetric data may capitalize on the infrastructure
that we have built. 

This talk will be of interest to any attendees interested in data visualization
and visual exploration of data. It will also be of interest to attendees that
have three-dimensional datasets that may be visualized using yt. yt has been
applied in several scientific domains, including astronomy, seismology, nuclear
engineering, and oceanography. This tool potentially can be extended to other
three-dimensional data visualization tools, so developers interested in adding
this functionality to their packages may also find this talk of interest.
