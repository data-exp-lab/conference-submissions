The Short Description:

This talk covers a tool developed for fast, interactive, browser-based
visualization of datasets using Jupyter widgets developed for use with yt. 
Jupyter widgets offer a unique opportunity to access the functionality in yt 
using a graphical interface, 
allowing for simultaneous control over the data and an 
ease-of-use not immediately accessible through the API
alone. Further, browser latency may be an issue with direct
visualization of data with a widget. By compiling our
pixelizer directly to webassebly, datasets can be interactively visualized
without delays resulting from transmission from yt to the browser.
