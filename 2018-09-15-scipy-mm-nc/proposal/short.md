The Short Description:

This talk covers a tool developed for fast, interactive, browser-based
interactivity of datasets using Jupyter widgets with yt. Jupyter widgets
offer a unique opportunity to access the functionality in yt 
using a graphical interface, 
allowing for a relatively high degree of control over the data and simultaneously 
providing the user with 
an accessibility and ease-of-use not traditionally accessible through the API
alone. Further, browser latency may be an issue with direct
exploration of data with a widget. By compiling our
pixelizer directly to webassebly, datasets can be interactively explored
without delays resulting from transmission from yt to the browser.
