The Short Description:


In this talk we will describe a tool developed for fast, interactive, browser-based
interactivity of datasets using Jupyter widgets developed for use with yt, a
python package for analyzing and visualizing volumetric data. Jupyter widgets
offer a unique opportunity to access the yt API using a graphical interface, 
allowing for high fidelity access of the data and simultaneously 
providing the user with 
an accessibility and ease-of-use not traditionally accessible through the API
alone. By compiling our
pixelizer directly to webassebly, datasets can be interactively explored
without delays resulting from transmission from yt to the browser.
